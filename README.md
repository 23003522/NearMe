   Lakeview Hospital .
This 128-bed, 210,000-square-foot acute care hospital opened in 1976 and is staffed by 226 physicians, representing more than 25 specialties and serving 51,800 patients each year.15-Jun-2016
In 2009 Craig Harris, Director of Facilities at Lakeview Hospital, determined that one of the hospital’s existing 200-ton chillers was beyond repair and needed replacement. Trane was awarded the contract and replaced the chiller with a new Trane RTHD Series R™ chiller that consumes only .55 kW per ton of chiller capacity at full load.
 Trane also replaced the cooling tower with a new Evapco unit and added a Tracer Summit chiller plant control system.
